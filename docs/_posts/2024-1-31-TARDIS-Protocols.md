As you may know there has been some protocols in the TARDIS now by activating these special
controls these things may happen depending on the number

Protocol 1913 AKA **Siege Mode**:
Seige Mode is a protocal that sends your TARDIS into lockdown mode, it is used as a final safety measure if all else fails. When Seige Mode is activated, the TARDIS will power down and deadlock seal the exterior doors, as well as shrinking the TARDIS to a smaller size in an attempt to stay out of sight while not using any power. This means that nothing will be able to enter the TARDIS, but you also will not have the ability to leave.
To deactivate Seige Mode, use the control assigned to Protocal 1913 once again and reactiviate the power.

Protocol 3 = **Cloak**:
Cloak is a protocal that renders your TARDIS invisible to the naked eye, this is at the cost of Artron energy however so cannot be used forever. This is used in the rare case that your TARDIS chamelion circuit has malfuctioned and your TARDIS has been identified by a third-party. When this protocal is activated, the TARDIS will still be seen while close by, but once a couple paces back it renders itself invisible to you.
To deactivate cloak, use the control assigned to Protocal 3.

Protocol 116 = Autopilot (Your TARDIS will automatically land upon takeoff)

Protocol 813 = Hail Mary (The TARDIS will depart and come to you when you are at low health)

Hope this helps!
