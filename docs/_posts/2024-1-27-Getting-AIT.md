## How do I get AIT's public release?
Recently, AIT's 1.20.1 fabric version has recently released for public beta!

The most recent public release can be found on [AIT's Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait) page here!

## How do I get AIT's early betas?
It is highly recommended that you **do NOT** use these versions, unless you are a beta tester in the MDTeam Server.

They are likely buggy and with temporary issues and tests, which is why they are beta testers only

Use these at your own risk, there may be little help/support.

The early betas can be found here on [Github Releases](https://github.com/M-D-Team/ait-fabric-1.20.1/releases)

## Note - when you find any bugs / crashes, please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/M-D-Team/ait-fabric-1.20.1/issues/new) or ask for help in the support channel in the discord.
